USAT-RD is a implemention of paper 'USAT: User stance aware attention network for rumor detection using semantic relation inference and temporal graph convolution', and is under reviewed by Nueral computing and applications.


The datasets we used in our paper are Pheme, Weibo16 and Weibo18. We provide the link to the original dataset and data processing code. The Pheme dataset can be download from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PHEME_dataset_of_rumours_and_non-rumours/4010619. and the Weibo18 dataset is avilable at https://github.com/thunlp/Chinese_Rumor_Dataset, the weibo16 dataset is avalable at https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ewzdrbelpmrnxu/rumdetect2017.zip?dl=0.

Details will coming soon.

User stance aware atterntion network for rumor detection

USAT-RD is a implemention of paper 'USAT: User stance aware attention network for rumor detection using semantic relation inference and temporal graph convolution', and has accepted by ICONIP2023.


The datasets we used in our paper are Pheme and Weibo. We provide the link to the original dataset and data processing code. The Pheme dataset can be download from https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PHEME_dataset_of_rumours_and_non-rumours/4010619. the weibo dataset is avalable at https://www.dropbox.com/s/7ewzdrbelpmrnxu/rumdetect2017.zip?dl=0.

Details will coming soon.
